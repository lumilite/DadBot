# DadBot
Bot for twitch channels that makes dad jokes and has a few other suprises

MAKE SURE TO CHANGE:
  username (username of your bot)
  password (OAuth token of bot, not plain text password!)
  channls (what channels you want the bot to run on, seperate each channel name with a comma.)
in bot.js file

The bot uses Node.js to function. Type Node bot.js in command line to run it.

The jokes.txt file contains a variety of dad approved jokes, will add more as time goes on.

If anyone has any functions they think might fit well or any good jokes, let me know!
